# Amazon-clone
I created a basic Amazon Clone using HTML and CSS to practice frontend web development skills. The project includes a responsive homepage layout with a navigation bar, product grid, banner images, and footerâ€”mimicking the look of the real Amazon site. It helped me understand the use of Flexbox, Grid, and media queries for responsive design.
